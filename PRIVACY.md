# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated: February 26, 2026**

## 1. Introduction
Redly ("we", "us", or "our") values your privacy. This Privacy Policy describes how your data is handled when you use the Redly application. 

**The core philosophy of Redly is: Your data belongs to you, and it stays with you.**

## 2. Data Collection
We do **not** collect, store, or transmit any personal data using this application.
- **No Account Required**: You do not need to create an account or provide an email address to use Redly.
- **No Telemetry**: We do not collect "usage data", analytics, or crash reports.
- **No Tracking**: There are no cookies, trackers, or advertising IDs in the application.

## 3. Data Storage
All data you create in Redly is stored locally on your own device:
- **Local Storage Mode**: If you select a local folder, your notes are stored as standard `.md` files in that folder. We have no access to this folder beyond the permissions you explicitly grant via your browser/OS.
- **Browser Storage Mode**: If you use the browser sandbox, your notes are stored in your browser's internal `IndexedDB`. This data is private to your browser instance.

## 4. Third-Party Services
Redly does **not** integrate with any third-party cloud services or APIs (e.g., Google Drive, Dropbox). Your data remains strictly local to your machine.

## 5. Hosting & Infrastructure
Redly is hosted using GitHub Pages. When you access the application, GitHub may collect standard server logs (such as IP addresses and browser types) for security and operational purposes. This data is handled by GitHub in accordance with their Privacy Statement. We do not have access to this data.

## 6. Your Controls
- **Deletion**: You can delete your data at any time by deleting the notes or folders within the app, or by clearing your browser's site data.
- **Portability**: You can export your Browser Storage data as a JSON backup or simply move your `.md` files to any other application at any time.

## 7. Contact
Since no data is collected, there is no personal information to manage. If you have questions about the application's architecture, please visit our GitHub repository.
