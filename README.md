### Your private, offline-first Markdown knowledge base.

Redly is a minimalist, powerful, and aesthetically pleasing note-taking application designed for people who value privacy, speed, and standard formats. It turns your local folders or browser storage into a sleek, searchable knowledge base.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Local-First Architecture**: Your data never leaves your machine unless you explicitly export it.
- **Markdown Native**: Write using standard Markdown with a beautiful, rich-text live preview.
- **Interactive Tasks**: Turn any note into a productivity hub with `@date` badges, interactive timelines, and a **Global Tasks Dashboard**.
- **Keyboard-First Navigation**: Optimized for power users with comprehensive hotkeys for every major action.
- **PWA Support**: Install Redly as a desktop app for a native experience.
- **Dark Mode**: Beautifully curated themes for both night owls and day dreamers.
- **Backup & Restore**: Easily export and import your browser storage as JSON.

## 📦 Getting Started

### 1. Choose Your Storage
- **Local Storage**: Map Redly to a folder on your computer. Your notes are stored as plain `.md` files that you can open with any other editor.
- **Browser Storage**: Store your notes in a secure, hidden browser sandbox. Zero-config and incredibly fast.

### 2. Create Your First Note
Click the **New Note** button or press `Alt + N`. Start typing! Use `#` for headers, `- [ ]` for tasks, and `---` for horizontal rules.

### 3. Add Deadlines
Type `@today`, `@friday 2pm`, or `@next monday` next to any task. Redly will automatically parse the date and color-code the badge.
